# LethalShock
A FOSS project to add PiShock support to Lethal Company

# Branch Info
This branch is intended for use with the game installed through proton on linux where the steam common folder is in the home `.steam` folder. The main Master Branch refrences the game at a diferent path which breaks the project by not having the refrences for the required assemblies. Otherwise this is compatable with Master except the `/LethalShock/LethalShock.csproj` file
# DISCLAIMER
Mrdab nor its contributors are responsible for any harm or misuse of both the PiShock nor this mod. **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
